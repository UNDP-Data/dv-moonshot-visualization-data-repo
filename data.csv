This foundational nature of the work to ensure the planetary health should not be underestimated.  The ambition of the UNDP Nature Pledge directly advances the poverty and finance Moonshot, and also support necessary work for the energy and election (governance) Moonshot. ","The ambition of the UNDP Nature Pledge aligns directly with the Poverty and Finance Moonshots, as well as the election Moonshot if we see this moonshot as a governance Moonshot.  It also aligns with the Energy Moonshot through our work around biodiversity mainstreaming in energy/mining industry, as well as our local-level support on micro-hydro, solar and other renewable energy support.  
The following summarises how implementation of the Nature Pledge would contribute to and align with the Moonshots.

Multidimensional Poverty 
Nature is positioned at the heart of sustainably development, and as an asset for human wellbeing
•Improve the livelihoods of 50 million people through nature-based enterprises and jobs
•Decreased vulnerability towards climate change impact and other external shocks
•Food security and water security is improved through protection and restoration of ecosystems

Sustainable Energy
Nature is positioned as an asset for renewable energy
•Renewable energy infrastructure, especially hydropower, is secured and improved through ecosystem protection and restoration
•Support for renewable energy infrastructure and installation at community level 
•Improved planning and practice of mining sectors reducing potential negative environmental impact of renewable energy 

Election - understanding this as broader governance Moonshot
Improved environmental governance and government accountability on nature and natural resources improves social cohesion, stability
•Improve environmental and natural resource governance through enhanced legal system, enforcement capacity and increased access to environmental justice
•Improve environmental justice
•Increase the use of legal and regulatory tools for environmental governance

Sustainable Finance
130 countries close the biodiversity finance gap through public and private finance and alignment of expenditures, catalysing:
•$100 billion new financing mobilized for nature from public and private sources;
•$ 200 billion nature-harmful subsidies redirected, repurposed and eliminated.
•Significant increase in private sector financing in the percentage of global companies’ portfolios

- improving environmental governance with enhanced policies, laws and regulations at national and sub-national levels, collaborative governance of conservation areas and natural resources at transnational, national and local levels, law enforcement; 
- development of sustainable finance mechanisms, including national biodiversity finance development through multi-sectoral approaches, including fiscal policy alignment to repurpose nature-negative finance;
- community livelihood and local economic development, including diversification of livelihoods, nature-based enterprise development, community -based enterprise development etc.
- promotion of small-scale renewable energy infrastructure development including installation of renewable energy equipment. ",,,
Millie Begovic ,Strategic Innovation Unit,Other,4.0,10,10.0,"The SIU team has developed capabilities & instruments that can support COs (and their partners) and BPPS (internally) to bring about coherence within and across existing moonshots and design & dynamically manage country-based efforts at pursuing moonshots.  Additionally, the team has relationships with partners who pursue transformative change in development and can be roped in for joint collaboration around moonshots. ",The SIU work points toward identifying & pursuing connections across the moonshots.  For example in increasing number of portfolios circular transition looks to expanding access to energy and lifting people out of poverty.  The finance piece is a common thread across all portfolios. ,The SIU work doesnt result in pursuit of a single moonshot but acts on synergies across them. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There are at least 3 products that the SIU team can put forward in pursuit of Moonshots: 
1) Deep Demonstrations is a vehicle that turns an ambition for system transformation into reality in the field- this has been tested with UNDP offices and their partners in over 50 countries.  The Deep Demonstrations offer a defined and codified process that helps generate more strategic value proposition for a country in tackling complex issues, identifies & acts on drivers of those issues & provides a more cohesive way of combining existing & leveraging new resources/knowledge both within the CO and externally partners.  It is a vehicle that can be deployed across number of countries specifically targeting those moonshots that are relevant nationally (or regionally if the Bureaus pursue moonshots). 

2) Sensemaking protocol is meant to generate coherence across the existing work, identifying synergies that can accelerate results in the field and gaps where UNDP can position in a particular field.  Applied within existing moonshots, it helps generate a narrative around evidence-based tactics that work in pursing moonshots across different development contexts, geographies, etc.  At the same time it provides an instrument for dynamic generating new interventions and decisions toward pursuit of the transformative goal.  Applies across the 4 moonshots, it can help identifying practical levers of change from the field (where work across individual moonshots may compound or dampen the progress in others) and signal the need to launch new moonshots that tackle emerging priorities globally. 

3) Partnership with organizations with transformative missions: from Institute for Innovation & Public Purpose and Societial Platforms to Gigatone Challenge, the SIU team can leverage collaboration with organizations with global reach, political access & approach to development that pursues systemic change that can reinforce our effort toward the moonshots.

Raquel Lagunas,Gender Equality,"Sustainable Energy: clean energy for 500M people,Sustainable Finance: promote the investment in SDGs,Multidimensional Poverty: 100M out of multidimensional poverty",3.0,10,10.0,"The GES 2022-2024 is aligned to the SP, and it emphasizes 2 moonshots:
a) ""By 2025, UNDP is committed to mobilize public and private sources of finance to channel $100 billions towards gender equality""
b) ..."" UNDP has set up itself the ambitious goal of closing energy gaps for 500 million people by 2025. At least half must be women.

As a result, our portfolio helps to advance these 2 moonshots through 2 new flagship initiatives:
a) EQUANOMICS- In collaboration with the SDG Financing Hub, the program works towards helping countries to unlocking financial resources through gender-responsive fiscal policies and tax reforms, and gender budgeting. Now, we are present in 16 countries, and we have a pipeline of 15 more countries seeking support and waiting for resource mobilization.  In this context, we also re-directed the program UNDP Gender Equality Seal for Public Institutions towards Ministries of Finance and Taxation institutions. The offer consists in tailored technical support to accompany fiscal and taxation reforms, complemented by a deeper public reform process using the Gender Equality Seal to ensure that Ministries of Finance and Taxation institutions sustains efforts.
Countries: Angola, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Eswatini, Georgia, Ghana, Maldives, Mongolia, Nigeria, Philippines, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Togo, Zimbabwe.
Pipeline: Armenia, Botswana, Colombia, Comoros, Egypt, Gabon, India, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Panama, Senegal, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Timor Leste, Uzbekistan.
INNFs- since 2022 we prioritized supporting the INNF program, investors mapping, gender-responsive green bons, and debt instruments to help unlocking financial resources for GEWE.
We also launched the EQUANOMICS Global Learning Lab targeting senior economists of UNDP to strengthen capacities of COs to implement this agenda. 

b) Powering Energy for Gender Equality - together with the Energy Hub, this new program present in 4 country offices in Africa aims to help UNDP Country Offices (COs) in Africa through existing and emerging large-scale energy programming, to increase women’s access to and control over sustainable energy products and services, while reducing their time poverty. It includes also one component of helping countries to formulate and adopt more inclusive and gender-responsive energy transition strategies and policies.  By injecting resources in existing high impact programmes, the value for money and results will grow exponentially.  
The programme is present in Comoros, Djibouti, Somalia, Benin, Nigeria with potential to scale up through the Miniguides programme and beyond.
Transition pipeline: Mongolia, India, Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, South Africa, Colombia, Kazakhstan

We plan to offer the UNDP Gender Equality Seal to the ""Climate Promise"", so we can impact in a broader ecosystem of public institutions as we are already doing in EQUANOMICS. The Seal as an accelerator of the moonshots.

Both moonshots are deeply connected to the moonshot on poverty. Any expansion of fiscal space for GEWE can help for instance to expand integrated care systems and help women to free time and access to the labor market. Green energy that considers also the burden that women carry and help to reduce time poverty will help to reduce their poverty.

Riad Meddeb,Sustainable Energy Hub,Sustainable Energy: clean energy for 500M people,1.0,7,7.0,"The UNDP’s 2022-2025 Strategic Plan has put sustainable energy at the heart of UNDP’s mission on sustainable development, aligned with the UN-Energy Plan of Action: to catalyze unprecedented action and partnerships to provide access to sustainable, affordable, and reliable energy to 500 more million people by 2025 and accelerate the transition to renewable energy through systemic changes that lead to inclusive green economies.
UNDP’s Sustainable Energy Hub (SEH) has been created to respond to these challenges to harness networks, experience, and innovation to accelerate sustainable energy systems transformation.  As a result, the SEH has already delivered a number of concrete initiatives designed to advance UNDP capacity to deliver the energy moonshot. 

For instance, the SEH has developed the Energy Moonshot Tracker. The objective of the tracker is to strengthen UNDP's internal monitoring mechanisms on collective progress towards the energy moonshot, the tracker analysis aims to identify the number of beneficiaries, both direct and indirect, for all UNDP energy projects active under the UNDP Strategic Plan for the period 2022-2025. The catalytic role of this exercise lays in improving exponentially the quality of the UNDP energy-related data to support COs, thus, providing for the first time, concrete guidelines for reporting on the energy moonshot. 

In collaboration with all 130 COs, the SEH has identified 118 countries that have active energy related projects, 936 outputs have been compiled from 330 projects. Based on analysis of all UNDP projects active during the Strategic Plan 2022-2025, UNDP sustainable energy portfolio includes over 330 interventions in 118 countries across 5 regions for the period of the Strategic Plan 2022-2025. UNDP counts an active portfolio of 102 VF energy related projects in 72 countries, which represents about $464 million in grant investment and $4.5 billion as co-financing.

In addition to the tracker, the SEH has developed a service line that goes beyond conventional project development and aims at amplifying exponentially the impact of sustainable energy systems transformation on the ground in order to respond to the Moonshot. It focuses on creating an encompassing ecosystem that addresses policy, finance, business development, scalability, and integration with the other moonshots. 

To realize this vision, the SEH has developed three accelerators that contribute to achieve the energy moonshot: Market Development, Thought Leadership, and Digital Intelligence.
1- Market Development service line: 
·        Energy Access Pipeline Accelerator to close the energy access gap. Aiming to generate a quality pipeline of bankable projects contributing to enabling the required increased annual investment in access to electricity to US$ 35 billion by 2025. 
-         To unlock investments, UNDP has developed an innovative financial mechanism, the De-risking Renewable Energy Investment (DREI). A bold ‘de-risking’ approach is embedded in the pioneering model the Africa Minigrids Program led by UNDP, which focuses on a range of ‘cost reduction levers’ including policy & regulations and leveraging innovative finance. This country-led technical assistance program for solar minigrids is now being rolled out in 21 countries across Africa. 
-         The UNDP-Italy Energy partnership. Focusing on a set of 8 African countries, the initiative is going to identify level action opportunities that will be converted to country-specific investment plans for scaling up energy access and other effective clean and sustainable energy solutions. 
-         Partnership with Deloitte to identify potential opportunities that can build on UNDP’s existing sustainable energy work portfolio to mobilize investments at scale. Opportunities have been identified to advance a strong pipeline of commercial investment opportunities. The pipeline development process would assess the impact potential, ecosystem viability and business viability of investment opportunities while designing targeted interventions that can address potential viability gaps. 

·        Market Development Facility to strengthen the Distributed Renewable Energy Ecosystem. The SEH aims to deploy specialized and tailored technical assistance to accelerate energy access investments can be scaled up by: 
1.      Green and Resilience Debt Platform: The GRDP (an initiative in partnership with EIB, EU Global Green Bond Initiative, NDF, UNDRR, UNCDF) aims to unlock up to $2 billion through green bond issuances by sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and corporate.
2.      Climate Aggregation Platform – Financial Innovation Challenge: Through the CAP Financial Innovation Challenge, UNDP has supported the development of seven solutions at the design stage, so that novel financial aggregation structures and models can be developed and lead to financially closed transactions in East Africa in the near future. 

2- Thought leadership service line:  
·        5 Regional Energy Strategies plus SIDS and Policy Papers on Social Protection, Gender Equality, Governance, Critical Minerals etc. 
·        Sustainable Energy Academy: The Academy aims to create concrete impact on the ground by providing countries with tailored made capacity building and a strong global community of experts and practitioners on energy for development.
·        UNDP Sustainable Hydrogen Facility for Country Office support: In the evolving landscape of hydrogen investments, the hydrogen technical support facility can play a vital role by bridging hydrogen investments with development opportunities.

3- Digital Intelligence service line:
·        Innovative Energy AI tool to support governments and policy makers at country level the development of an AI Energy Language Model, a sophisticated tool incorporating natural language processing. Geospatial toolkit for renewable energy stands as a testament to our commitment to precision. The SEH works on data generated in collaboration, academia, and research institutes on this platform to identify electrification rates, maps renewable energy potential and data-driven energy trends. 
·        The Decarbonization Tool allow us to align with national governments through tailored workshops, the development of an energy transition Policy Pathways Tool and a National Energy Transitions Playbook with recommendations to chart a path forward for an individual country. 
","The SEH drives a nexus approach focused on integrated and interdependent programming, including through program portfolios, policy support and institutional strengthening. It draws on expertise in governance, social protection, gender equality and energy finance applied to energy systems transformation to ensure and provide an integrated approach on sustainable energy for development. 

Through the Energy Moonshot Tracker, the Sustainable Energy Academy, the Energy Access Accelerator Pipeline and the other initiatives, the SEH aims to integrate the work on sustainable energy with the other moonshots.

First and foremost, the SEH's initiatives are instrumental in supporting the goal of helping 100 million people escape multidimensional poverty. Through initiatives like the Energy Access Pipeline Accelerator, the Sustainable Energy Academy and the Africa Minigrids Program, the SEH catalyzes investment in energy infrastructure, facilitating economic growth, strenghen capa and ultimately uplifting communities from poverty.
Moreover, the SEH's strategic approach significantly contributes to promoting over US$1 trillion of public expenditure and private capital investment in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By fostering innovative financial mechanisms like the De-risking Renewable Energy Investment (DREI), Market Development Facilities, and partnerships with entities like Deloitte and the European Investment Bank, the SEH unlocks financial resources essential for scaling up sustainable energy projects. The emphasis on creating bankable projects and mobilizing commercial investment opportunities amplifies the impact of capital flow into sustainable energy, further aligning with broader SDG financing objectives.

As the Co-Chair of UN-Energy, UNDP, trough the SEH, is also engaging the entire UN system to deliver on the UN-Energy Pledge: to catalyse unprecedented action and partnerships to provide access to sustainable, affordable, and reliable energy to 500 more million people by 2025 and accelerate the transition to renewable energy through systemic changes that lead to inclusive green economies.  Unlocking finance and investment through effective sector coordination and inter-agency collaboration is a priority to ensure an integrated approach. Under UNDP leadership, UN-Energy will soon launch its Powering Progress initiative in 5 countries (i.e., Cambodia, Haiti, Somalia, Tanzania, Madagascar) among the 5 regions, to deliver integrated actions and countries political commitment on closing energy access gap, to showcase the transformative impact of joint UN partnership on the ground.

The SDG 16 Research and Engagement Agenda contributes to the Moonshot on “100million people out of poverty” by supporting evidence-based policy making to address governance challenges that often reinforce poverty and inequality. Specifically, the work supported by the Global Policy Centre for Governance aims to strengthen data, analytics, and insights on governance, especially on the four custodian indicators under SDG 16 on people’s satisfaction with public services (health, education and other government services – 16.6.2), access to dispute resolution mechanisms (16.3.3), representation in the public service and the judiciary (16.7.1) and political efficacy (16.7.2). Support is also provided to countries to implement initiatives such as SDG 16 Survey to better understand governance challenges as well as prevalence of violence, discrimination, and corruption, among others. Strengthening data availability and insight on these factors can help countries better understand and address barriers to overcoming multi-dimensional poverty and develop more inclusive policy options that target population groups that are at risk of being left behind.

Sustainable Energy: clean energy for 500M people
The Centre contributes to the Moonshot ‘Sustainable Energy: clean energy for 500M people’ through its current Research and Engagement Agenda on ‘Unpacking the Political Economy of a Fair Green Transition’. Specifically, together with UNDP’s Sustainable Energy Hub and Climate Hub, the Centre is developing case studies on how countries are managing a just energy transition from a governance perspective which will be presented at HLPF 2024. Work has started with Nigeria and will include 2-3 additional countries. The case study methodology draws on UNDP’s Energy Governance Framework launched in 2023 and is meant to inspire the case study countries and others to identify and address governance challenges and opportunities in driving a just energy transition. 

Elections: 800M people to participate in elections -
The Information Integrity for an Open, Inclusive Public Sphere and Informed Civic Engagement Research and Engagement Agenda plays a facilitating role in the '800 million People to Participate in Elections' Moonshot by providing programmatic support and policy advice to address the challenges of information pollution during elections. Elections are targeted by actors seeking political, financial, or ideological gain, often by aiming to undermine the legitimacy of the process, suppress voter turnout, distort public debate, or stir discontent over election outcomes. Leveraging UNDP's extensive electoral support experience and broader governance programming, promoting information integrity during elections is becoming a crucial aspect of UNDP’s electoral assistance work. The Global Policy Centre for Governance works with the Chief Digital Office and the elections team to provide country offices with effective programmatic options to protect information integrity during elections. These initiatives contribute to protection of the information landscape and civic space around elections but also foster an environment favorable to informed and meaningful civic engagement, ensuring that citizens can make well-informed decisions during the voting process. Additionally, it contributes to electoral support by fostering engagement between technology companies, electoral management bodies, civil society, fact-checking organizations, and electoral support groups with national institutions and international support actors. Currently, the Global Policy Center actively engages in enhancing information sharing and learning across electoral stakeholders. It leads the Action Coalition on Information Integrity in Elections which focuses on developing actionable programmatic recommendations for electoral stakeholders with the aim to optimize the positive potential of technologies, while minimizing harms; to strengthen the ability to assert democratic rights; and to enhance transparency and build trust in electoral processes.

Sustainable Finance: promote the investment in SDGs -
The Centre also contributes to the Moonshot ‘Sustainable Finance: promote the investment in SDGs’ through its Research and Engagement Agenda on ‘Financial Integrity and Economic Governance’. Specifically, in 2024 and 2025, the Centre will work closely with key internal and external partners to ensure that governance and financial integrity issues are addressed in the preparation of a new Financing for Development (FfD) framework, due to be agreed by member states in 2025. It is also kickstarting innovative, systems-based research on transnational corruption (with focus on Africa), looking at the corruption value chain of actors from source to destination countries and its international enablers.","Each Research and Engagement Agenda being undertaken by GPCG supports a moonshot.
